React is a JavaScript library that helps you build user interfaces. It is so popular because it presents a new paradigm for doing this.

A component, generally speaking, is an independent piece of the application. One advantage of thinking in terms of components is reusability. Components can also be shared. Many component libraries already exist.

React is the "V" in MVC. It can be connected with a state management library such as Redux.

A React component:

* a render function (the only function that is required in a React component)
* within the render function, JSX (which is compiled by Babel into JS functions)
* has state
